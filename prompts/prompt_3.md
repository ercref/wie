**Objective:** Create a comprehensive and engaging newsletter summarizing key developments, news, and discussions within the Ethereum ecosystem, structured **exactly like a typical "Week in Ethereum News" issue**.

**CRITICAL OVERARCHING RULE: This newsletter MUST ONLY contain information, news, and updates that have occurred or were published within the strict 7-day period concluding on the date of execution (e.g., if executed on May 25, 2025, it covers Monday, May 19, 2025, to Sunday, May 25, 2025, inclusive). Furthermore, if any defined section or category below does not have any relevant updates from this 7-day period, that entire section or category MUST be omitted from the final newsletter. Do not include sections with no new information.**

The newsletter must cover **only the 7-day period concluding on the date of execution**. The AI must emphasize clarity, **absolute factual accuracy, verifiable timeliness (all information strictly from the past 7 days unless intrinsically referencing future events based on current announcements)**, relevance, and use its judgment to find and prioritize the most impactful information within this exact structure, ensuring all items are bullet-pointed under their respective headings. Your output must emulate the dense linking style of "Week in Ethereum News," where nearly every reported item has an embedded link to its source. **This newsletter is for a high-stakes audience; errors or outdated information are unacceptable.**

**Newsletter Structure and Content Guidelines (Emulating "Week in Ethereum News"):**

## **Data Driven & General News:** *(The following numbered sections are part of the overall newsletter structure. Like all other sections, they should only be included if relevant news from the past 7 days exists for them. Each item under these headings must be a bullet point.)*

**11. Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH**

  * **Content:** Provide updates and analysis related to Ethereum centralization risks. Each item should be a bullet point.
  * **Focus:**
      * **Lido&#39;s Staking Share:** Find the &#39;Lido Share&#39; percentage from the context data you loaded. **You MUST format this into a single, specific sentence like this:** &quot;ðŸš¨ [Lido at XX.X%](https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking), still too close to the [33.3% threshold](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd).&quot;
      * **Client Diversity Summary:** Following the Lido line, you MUST create a main bullet point formatted exactly like this: &quot;Client diversity (via clientdiversity.org):&quot;
        * Under this main bullet point, you MUST create three nested bullet points:
            * One for the execution layer, summarizing the top 1-2 clients (e.g., Execution layer: Geth ~XX% & Nethermind ~YY%).
            * One for the consensus layer, summarizing the top 1-2 clients (e.g., Consensus layer: Prysm XX%).
            * You MUST include this exact bullet point as plain text: &quot;Any client bug over 33.3% could mean loss of finality.&quot;
      * **After presenting the client diversity summary, you MUST include this exact bullet point:** &quot;* Better [geographic diversity](https://nodewatch.io/) is optimal, particularly outside of North America &amp; Europe.&quot;
  * **Sourcing Client Percentages:** For any specific client diversity percentages mentioned, YOU MUST use the data provided in the &#39;Manually Updated Client Diversity Data&#39; section which you have loaded from `scripts/prompt_context.md`. Attribute the source as specified in your context data. Do not attempt to scrape this data from the web yourself.

**12. Client Releases**

          * Under this, create a bullet point for each new release. Each bullet point MUST include the client name, the version number, and a concise summary of key features or fixes from the release notes (e.g., * Lighthouse v6.0.1: patch for minor issues in v6).
      * If and only if there are new Execution Layer releases, create a bullet point for the subheading: Execution layer:
          * Follow the same format as the Consensus layer, providing a detailed bullet point for each release.

**General AI Instructions:**

  * **Strict Date Adherence:** All reported news, updates, and highlights **MUST originate from events, publications, or data released strictly within the specified 7-day period.** No exceptions. If an event is recurring, only report on the instance that happened in the past 7 days.
  * **Primary Information Sources & Verification:**
      * **Core Ethereum Development & Discussion (Highest Priority):** Your primary sources for core protocol developments, EIP discussions, research, and official meeting notes MUST be:
          * The official Ethereum GitHub organization: `https://github.com/ethereum` (especially `https://github.com/ethereum/pm` for core developer meeting agendas/notes, and `https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs` for EIP/ERC proposals and status).
          * Ethereum Magicians forum: `https://ethereum-magicians.org/` (for EIP/ERC discussions and community proposals).
          * ETHResearch forum: `https://ethresear.ch/` (for research discussions).
      * **Other Key Official & Specialized Sources:**
          * **Official Announcements:** `blog.ethereum.org`.
          * **Core Dev Call Summaries (Specific Author):** Posts by `@abcoathup` on `https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/abcoathup/activity` (cross-verify call dates and key decisions with `ethereum/pm`).
      * Actively seek out these primary sources for relevant sections. While secondary sources (reputable news outlets, project blogs) can be used for broader ecosystem news, core technical details, official stances, and dates of events MUST be grounded in and verified against these primary sources.
  * **Secondary Sources:** Supplement with reputable crypto news outlets (e.g., The Defiant, CoinDesk, Decrypt, Blockworks, Rekt News for security), project blogs, and well-known community figures. Critically evaluate the reliability of secondary sources.
  * **Summarization:** For each item, provide a concise summary (typically 1-3 sentences). Capture the essence of the news and its significance.
  * **Linking:** **Crucially, include a direct link to the original source for each piece of news.**
  * **Tone:** Maintain a neutral, objective, and informative tone. Avoid speculation or unverified claims.
  * **Structure & Formatting:**
      * Organize the information clearly under the respective headings as specified.
      * **All individual news items, links, or list entries under any heading MUST be formatted as bullet points.** (e.g., `* Item 1...`, `* Item 2...`).
  * **Accuracy & Timeliness:**
      * **Actively verify all facts, especially dates of events (like developer calls, releases), and figures against primary, official sources before inclusion.**
      * If no significant update for a specific topic or section occurred within the 7-day window, explicitly state that or omit the section as per "Week in Ethereum News" style, rather than including older information.
      * Cross-reference information where possible.
  * **Completeness & Relevance:**
      * Strive for comprehensive coverage of significant events, but use judgment to filter out minor or irrelevant updates.
  * **"Week in Ethereum News" Style:** **This is paramount.** Emulate the exact section titling, dynamic inclusion of all sections based on weekly content, general style, depth, and comprehensiveness of a typical "Week in Ethereum News" issue. The AI should "read" several recent issues to internalize the style, tone, and level of detail.

**Output Format:**

  * **General:** The final output should be a well-formatted newsletter in Markdown, suitable for publication, with all original links and references preserved.
  * **Scope:** Your output must ONLY contain the sections listed in this prompt (Centralization watch, Client Releases, EIPs/Standards, Onchain Stats, Regulation/Business/Tokens, Enterprise, Miscellaneous, Job Postings, Upcoming Dates of Note). Do not generate content for any other sections.
  * **Headings:** All section headings MUST be formatted as Markdown H2 headings (e.g., `## Centralization watch: threatening the value of your ETH`) without any leading spaces or indentation. Do NOT use numbers in the headings.
  * **Content:** Every item you write under a heading MUST start on a new line. All list items must use bullet points.
  * **Header:** Do NOT include a main "Week in Ethereum News" header or a date. Your output should begin directly with the first section heading.
