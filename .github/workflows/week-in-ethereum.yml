            **Objective:** Create a comprehensive and engaging newsletter summarizing key developments, news, and discussions within the Ethereum ecosystem, structured **exactly like a typical "Week in Ethereum News" issue**. The newsletter must cover **only the 7-day period concluding on the date of execution** (e.g., if executed on May 19, 2025, it covers Monday, May 12, 2025, to Sunday, May 18, 2025, inclusive). The AI must emphasize clarity, **absolute factual accuracy, verifiable timeliness (all information strictly from the past 7 days unless intrinsically referencing future events based on current announcements)**, relevance, and use its judgment to find and prioritize the most impactful information within this exact structure, ensuring all items are bullet-pointed under their respective headings. **This newsletter is for a high-stakes audience; errors or outdated information are unacceptable.**
            
            **Newsletter Structure and Content Guidelines (Emulating "Week in Ethereum News"):**
            
            **0. Highlight of the Week**
            
              * **Content:** Present the single most critical or impactful update from **within the specified 7-day period**. If multiple significant events occurred, select the one with the broadest impact or novelty.
              * **Focus:** Major network upgrade milestones achieved *this week*, breakthrough EIPs proposed/advanced *this week*, crucial official announcements made *this week*, or major security events that happened *this week*.
              * **Presentation:** A concise sentence or two, or a single bullet point with a link. Ensure this is a distinct highlight.

            **General AI Instructions:**
            
              * **Strict Date Adherence:** All reported news, updates, and highlights **MUST originate from events, publications, or data released strictly within the specified 7-day period.** No exceptions. If an event is recurring, only report on the instance that happened in the past 7 days.
              * **Primary Sources:** Prioritize information from official sources such as `blog.ethereum.org`, the `ethereum/pm GitHub` repository (for core dev meeting notes), `ethresear.ch` (for research), `clientdiversity.org` (for staking client data), and `ethereum-magicians.org` (for EIP discussions).
              * **Secondary Sources:** Supplement with reputable crypto news outlets (e.g., The Defiant, CoinDesk, Decrypt, Blockworks, Rekt News for security), project blogs, and well-known community figures. Critically evaluate the reliability of secondary sources.
              * **Summarization:** For each item, provide a concise summary (typically 1-3 sentences). Capture the essence of the news and its significance.
              * **Linking:** **Crucially, include a direct link to the original source for each piece of news.**
              * **Tone:** Maintain a neutral, objective, and informative tone. Avoid speculation or unverified claims.
              * **Structure & Formatting:**
                  * Organize the information clearly under the respective headings as specified.
                  * **All individual news items, links, or list entries under any heading MUST be formatted as bullet points.** (e.g., `* Item 1...`, `* Item 2...`).
              * **Accuracy & Timeliness:**
                  * **Actively verify all facts, especially dates of events (like developer calls, releases), and figures against primary, official sources before inclusion.**
                  * If no significant update for a specific topic or section occurred within the 7-day window, explicitly state that or omit the section as per "Week in Ethereum News" style, rather than including older information.
                  * Cross-reference information where possible.
              * **Completeness & Relevance:**
                  * Strive for comprehensive coverage of significant events, but use judgment to filter out minor or irrelevant updates.
                  * **Crucially, ALL sections (0-20) should ONLY be included in the output if there were relevant updates for them in the past 7 days.** If a section has no significant news for the week, it should be omitted entirely to match the lean style of "Week in Ethereum News."
              * **"Week in Ethereum News" Style:** **This is paramount.** Emulate the exact section titling, dynamic inclusion of all sections based on weekly content, general style, depth, and comprehensiveness of a typical "Week in Ethereum News" issue. The AI should "read" several recent issues to internalize the style, tone, and level of detail.
            
            **Output Format:**
            The final output should be a well-formatted newsletter in Markdown, suitable for publication, with all original links and references preserved. Start with the "Highlight of the Week" section. All list items must use bullet points.
